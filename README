Introduction:
=================================
This is a CRUD application that stores places of interest in a database and displays them either using a list or a grid layout back to the user.
The user can add, edit or delete places from the database.






Things I don’t know how to do:
=================================

1. Application appears to be slow at runtime (delete request literally takes 5-10s when it should be in the milliseconds). It seems that the Play app is waiting to connect to the database. Not sure why, as this issue doesn't occur in the Java implementation of this project.

2. Would like to merge the PlaceData class into the Place class, but don’t know how to validate whether a user a uploaded a picture (I would like this to be a requirement).

3. Use Place objects in the routes file instead of Int, but not sure how to uniquely represent a Place object in a URL without using a UUID (not a good idea to expose the internals of the application in the URL).

4. Would like to improve the tests that I have currently written. Not sure how to include a mock object in a HTTP request to the web app.

5. Getting flash messages to show up on some redirect requests.
