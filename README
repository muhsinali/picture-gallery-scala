Introduction:
=================================
This is a CRUD application that stores places of interest in a database and displays them either using a list or a grid layout back to the user.
The user can add, edit or delete places from the database.






Things I don’t know how to do:
=================================

1. Application appears to be slow at runtime (delete request literally takes 5-10s). It seems that the Play app is waiting to connect to the database. Not sure why, as there’s only ~20mb stored in the database, so processing a request should be in the milliseconds.

2. Would like to merge the PlaceData class into the Place class, but don’t know how to validate whether a user a uploaded a picture (I would like this to be a requirement).

3. Use Place objects in the routes file instead of Int, but not sure how to uniquely represent a Place object in a URL without using a UUID.

4. Would like to improve the tests that I have currently written. Not sure how to include a mock object in a HTTP request to the web app.

5. Getting flash messages to show up on some redirect requests.
